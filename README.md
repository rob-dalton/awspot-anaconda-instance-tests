# base-awspot-anaconda-resource
Base files for awspot anaconda resources. Contains configuration and setup tests. New awspot based anaconda projects should be forked from this repo.

Before running tests, ensure that `awscli` has been configured on the resource. Tests assume the machine is configured with AWS credentials for a user with S3 read, write and list permissions.
